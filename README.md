# ExitIntent v1.0.0

Stops user navigation when they're about to leave a page without saving their changes. If a user is about to navigate away from a page, throw a mendix confirmation box to ask them if they'd like to save their saves. If they pick yes, commit any objects changed before continuing to the next page.

## Instructions

1. Install the widget in your project.
2. Insert the widget as a child widget of a data view on a page.
